# SPIRAL: Interactive Reasoning Game Simulator

A practical, interactive tool based on the SPIRAL paper ("Self-Play on Zero-Sum Games Incentivizes Reasoning via Multi-Agent Multi-Turn Reinforcement Learning") deployed on Hugging Face Spaces.

## Overview

This tool demonstrates how self-play training on zero-sum games can improve AI reasoning capabilities. Users can:

- **Play Games**: Engage with AI in games like Kuhn Poker and TicTacToe
- **View Reasoning**: See step-by-step AI reasoning traces during gameplay
- **Test Transfer**: Evaluate AI's reasoning skills on math problems and logic puzzles
- **Learn**: Understand AI decision-making through interactive visualizations

## Features

### For Non-Technical Users
- Simple web interface for playing games
- Visual reasoning explanations
- Educational tutorials about AI thinking
- No setup required - runs in browser

### For Technical Users
- Access to model weights and training scripts
- API endpoints for extending the system
- Custom game integration capabilities
- Fine-tuning examples and documentation
