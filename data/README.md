# Data Directory

This directory contains datasets and game-related files for the SPIRAL project.

## Structure

- `games/` - Game datasets and rule definitions
- `benchmarks/` - Math and logic benchmarks for transfer testing (e.g., GSM8K)
- `training/` - Training data and logs
- `examples/` - Example game sessions and reasoning traces

## Data Sources

- Game implementations from GitHub repositories
- Math benchmarks like GSM8K for transfer evaluation
- Custom game datasets generated during training
